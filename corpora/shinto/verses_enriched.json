The name of the Deity that was next born as he washed his right august eye was His Augustness, Moon-Night Possessor.

With regard to the word Idzumo which they, in deference to the opinions of the native commentators, render by \"clouds which come forth\" or \"forth-issuing clouds\" (the Chinese characters  with which the word is written having that signification), the present writer cannot persuade himself that such a corruption as idzumo for ide-kumo either retained at the time of the composition of the song, or should now be credited with, the signification which this its supposed etymology assigns to it. The etymology moreover is far from being established, and in this, as in many other cases, the Chinese characters used to write the name of the province of Idzumo, may well have rested on nothing more than a vague similarity of sound, and probably no European scholar would endorse the opinion of the native commentators, to whom the \"Records\" are a sacred book, that the province of Idzumo received its name from this very poem. On the other hand, we need have no difficulty in conceding that the Pillow-Word ya-kumo-tatsu, by which Idzumo is preceded in poetical compositions, did probably here originate.--This song is in the \"Chronicles\" only quoted in a note, for which reason some authorities dispute its antiquity. In the note in question, we find the reading -gome (the \"Records\" have -gomi), the Transitive form instead of the Intransitive. If this were adopted, the translation would have to run thus: . . . . . \"The eight-fold fence of Idzumo makes an eight-fold fence to shut up the spouse[s?] in;\" and probably \"spouse\" should be understood in the Feminine to mean \"wife.\""

The reason for their leaving it was this: Each of these eighty Deities had in his heart the wish to marry the Princess of Yakami  in Inaba,  and they went together to Inaba, putting their bag on [the back of] the Deity Great-Name-Possessor, whom they took with them as an attendant. Hereupon. when they arrived at Cape Keta,  [they found] a naked hare lying down. Then the eighty Deities spoke to the hare, saying: \"What thou shouldest do is to bathe in the sea-water here, and lie on the slope of a high mountain exposed to the blowing of the wind.\" So the hare followed the instructions of the eighty Deities, and lay down. Then, as the sea-water dried, the skin of its body all split with the blowing of the wind, so that it lay weeping with pain. But the Deity Great-Name-Possessor, who came last of all, saw the hare, and said: \"Why liest thou weeping?\" The hare replied, saying: \"I was in the Island of Oki,  and wished to cross over to this land, but had no means of crossing over.

Hereby shall we know whether it or my tribe is the larger.' Upon my speaking thus, they were deceived and lay down in a row, and I trod on them and counted them as I came across, and was just about to get on land, when I said: 'You have been deceived by me.' As soon as I had finished speaking, the crocodile who lay the last of all seized me and stripped off all my clothing. As I was weeping and lamenting for this reason, the eighty Deities who went by before [thee] commanded and exhorted me, saying: 'Bathe in the salt water, and lie down exposed to the wind.' So, on my doing as they had instructed me, my whole body was hurt.\" Thereupon the Deity Great-Name-Possessor instructed the hare, saying: \"Go quickly now to the river-mouth, wash thy body with the fresh water, then take the pollen of the sedges [growing] at the river-mouth, spread it about, and roll about upon it, whereupon thy body will certainly be restored to its original state.\"  So [the hare] did as it was instructed, and its body became as it had been originally. This was the White Hare of Inaba.  It is now called the Hare Deity. So the hare said to the Deity Great-Name-Possessor: \"These eighty Deities shall certainly not get the Princess of Yakami.

So then, owing to the elder sister being very hideous, [His Augustness Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty] was alarmed at the sight of her, and sent her back, only keeping the younger sister Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, whom he wedded for one night. Then the Deity-Great-Mountain-Possessor was covered with shame at Princess Long-as-the-Rocks being sent back, and sent a message [to His Augustness Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty], saying: \"My reason for respectfully presenting both my daughters together was that, by sending Princess-Long-as-the-Rocks, the august offspring  of the Heavenly Deity,  though the snow  fall and the wind blow, might live eternally immovable like unto the enduring rocks, and again that by sending Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, [they] might live flourishingly like unto the flowering of the blossoms of the trees: to insure this,  I offered  them. But owing to thy thus sending back  Princess Long-as-the-Rocks, and keeping only Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, the august offspring of the Heavenly Deity shall be but as frail  as the flowers of the trees. So it is for this"

Then the Kumaso bravo spoke, saying: \"Do not move the sword; I  have something to say.\" Then [His Augustness Wo-usu], respited him for a moment, holding him down [as he lay] prostrate. Hereupon [the bravo] said: \"Who is Thine Augustness?\" Then he said: \"I am the august child of Oho-tarashi-hiko-oshiro-wake, the Heavenly Sovereign who, dwelling in the palace of Hishiro at Makimuku, rules the Land of the Eight Great Islands; and my name is King Yamato-wo-guna. Hearing that you two [fellows ], the Kumaso bravoes, were unsubmissive and disrespectful, [the Heavenly Sovereign] sent me with the command to take and slay you.\" Then the Kumaso bravo said: \"That must  be true. There are no persons in the West so brave and strong as we two.  Yet in the Land of Great Yamato there is a man braver than we two,--there is.  Therefore will I offer thee an august name. From this time forward it is right that thou be praised as the August Child Yamato-take.\"  As soon as he had finished saying this, [the Prince] ripped him up  like a ripe"

Then he spoke to his elder brother, saying: \"I have obtained the Mayden-of-Idzushi.\" Thereupon the elder brother, vexed that the younger brother should have wedded her, did not pay the things he had wagered. Then when [the younger brother] complained to his mother, his august parent replied, saying: \"During my august life the Deities indeed are to be well imitated; moreover it must be because he imitates mortal men  that he does not pay those things.\" Forthwith, in her anger with her elder child, she took a jointed bamboo  from an island in the River Idzushi, and made a coarse basket with eight holes,  and took stones from the river, and mixing them with brine, wrapped them in the leaves of the bamboo  and caused this curse to be spoken:  \"Like unto the becoming green of these bamboo-leaves, [do thou] become green and wither!  Again, like unto the flowing and ebbing of this brine  [do thou] flow and ebb! Again, like unto the sinking of these stones, [do thou] sink and be prostrate! \"Having caused this curse to be spoken, she placed [the basket] over the smoke.  Therefore the elder brother dried up, withered, sickened, and lay prostrate  for the space of eight years. So on the elder brother entreating his august parent with lamentations and fears, she forthwith caused the curse to be reversed.  Thereupon his body became sound  as it had been before. (This is the origin of the term \"a divine wager payment.\")"

This is unrighteous. Nevertheless if I reward not his deed, I may be called untruthful; and if I quite carry out my promise, his intentions are on the contrary to be feared. So, though recompensing his deed, I will destroy his actual person.\" Therefore he said to Sobakari: \"I will halt here to-day and bestow on thee the rank of Prime Minister, and to-morrow will [continue my] progress up.\" So a halt was made at the entrance to the mountain, a temporary palace forthwith built, a copious feast  suddenly held, the rank of Prime Minister forthwith bestowed on the man-at-arms, and all the officials  made to do obeisance [to him]. The man-at-arms, delighted, thought that he had accomplished his design.

Hereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, being very angry, fixed his arrow [in his bow], and the various officials all fixed their arrows [in their bows]. Then those people also all fixed their arrows [in their bows]. So the Heavenly Sovereign again sent to ask, saying: \"Then tell thy name. Then let each of us tell his name, and [then] let fly his arrow.\" Thereupon [the other] replied, saying: \"As I was the first to be asked, I will be the first to tell my name. I am the Deity who dispels with a word the evil and with a word the good,--the Great Deity of Kadzuraki, Lord of One"
